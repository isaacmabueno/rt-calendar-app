This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Challenge

React calendar app.

## Limitations

1. Must use React
2. Code must be source controlled in a public git repo
3. You can use any other open source tools to help you

## App specs

1. Display all dates for *at least* current month
2. Appointments *cannot* be created in the past
3. Appointments should appear on the calendar
4. No two appointments should overlap
5. If an appointment exists for a day, a warning should display
6. Appointments can be edited and deleted

## How to use

1. Clone down this repo `git clone git@github.com:isaacmabueno/rt-calendar-app.git`
2. Once the repo has been cloned locally, run `npm install`
3. On success of `npm install`, simply run `npm start` for the app to open locally.
